# Developer Intro

An `xcall` can be initiated from a smart contract to send funds and/or conduct arbitrary execution _across domains_. This allows Connext to be used as a base cross-chain layer that can be integrated into dApps, turning them into **xApps**.

You can use Connext to build xApps like:

- Bridges to transfer ERC-20 tokens between blockchains
- Crosschain DeFi protocols
- Crosschain NFTs
and more!

Start building cross-chain applications in no time with our Quickstart or see our Guides for more in-depth examples.
