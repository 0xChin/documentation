# Connext Subgraph Introduction

Cnnext uses multiple subgraphs for indexing and organizing data from the Connext smart contracts. These subgraphs are hosted on The Graph hosted service and can be used to query Connext data.

## Production Endpoints
Each version of Connext has its own dedicated subgraph, and governance contracts have a dedicated subgraph as well.

Each subgraph has a dedicated endpoint for querying data, as well as a page on The Graph explorer the exposes the schema and available fields to query.
