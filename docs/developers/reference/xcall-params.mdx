| Name                | Type       | Description     |
|---------------------|------------|-----------------|
| `_destination`      | `uint32`   | The destination chain's Domain ID (*not* equivalent to “Chain ID”).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `_to`               | `address`  | The address on the destination chain. Whether it’s a user’s wallet or the address of another contract depends on the desired use of `xcall`. <br/>If the `xcall` is just used to bridge funds, then the user should be able to specify where the funds get sent to. <br/> If the xcall is used to send calldata to a target contract, then this address must be the address of that contract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `_asset`            | `address`  | The contract address of the asset to be bridged. This could be the adopted, local, or canonical asset (see [this](./faq#what-does-it-mean-when-referring-to-canonical-representation-and-adopted-assets) for an explanation of the different kinds of assets). <br/> Usually a xApp will have a higher-level function wrapping `xcall` in which the asset will be passed as an argument. This allows users to specify which asset they want to work with. <br/> If the `xcall` is calldata-only (e.g. doesn't bridge any funds), any registered asset can be used here as long as `amount: 0`.
| `_delegate`         | `address`  | The address on destination domain that should receive funds if the execution fails. This ensures that funds are never lost with failed calls. It can also act on behalf of the sender to take certain actions in case of unfavorable slippage conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `_amount`           | `uint256`  | The amount of tokens to bridge specified in standard format (i.e. to send 1 USDC, a token with 10^18 decimals, you must specify the amount as `1000000000000000000`).
| `_slippage`         | `uint256`  | The maximum slippage a user is willing to take, in BPS, due to the StableSwap Pool(s), if applicable. <br/> For example, to achieve 0.03% slippage tolerance this will be `3`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `_callData`         | `bytes`    | In the case of bridging funds only, this should be empty (""). If calldata is sent, then the encoded calldata must be passed here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
