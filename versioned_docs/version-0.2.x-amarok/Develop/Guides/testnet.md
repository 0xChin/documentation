# Testing NXTP Against Testnets

Connext’s public testnet is available on Kovan ←→ Rinkeby. The Test Token mentioned in each chain description has an open mint function with the signature `mint(address account, uint256 amount)`. Swaps are enabled between Test Tokens on the different chains.

Please ping the team to have more testnet assets and swaps added!
