# Developer Intro

An `xcall` can be initiated from a smart contract to send funds and/or conduct arbitrary execution _across domains_. This allows Connext to be used as a base cross-chain layer that can be integrated into dApps, turning them into **xApps**.

For example, here are interesting use cases that the protocol enables:

- Hold a governance vote on one chain and execute the outcome of it on another (plus other DAO operations)
- Lock-and-mint or burn-and-mint token bridging
- Perform a swap and transfer the received tokens across chains
- Connecting DEX liquidity across chains in a single seamless transaction
- Crosschain vault zaps and vault strategy management
- Critical protocol operations such as replicating/syncing global constants (e.g. PCV) across chains
- Bringing UniV3 TWAPs to every chain without introducing oracles
- Chain-agnostic veToken governance
- Metaverse-to-metaverse interoperability
