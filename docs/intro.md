# NXTP Developer Docs

NXTP (Noncustodial Xchain Transfer Protocol) is a lightweight protocol for generalized xchain/xrollup transactions that retain the security properties of the underlying execution environment (i.e. it does not rely on any external validator set).

## Components

### [SDK](./sdk/getting-started)

The SDK is an isomorphic library that allows you to interact with the NXTP network to perform xchain transfers.

### [Router](./router/intro)

The router is an offchain component that provides liquidity and facilitates xchain transfers.
