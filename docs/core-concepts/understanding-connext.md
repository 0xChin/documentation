# What is Connext?

:::info 
The Core Concepts section is still under construction! 
:::

Connext powers fast, trust-minimized communication between blockchains.

Our goal is to create a world where:

1. Users never need to know what chain or rollup they're on (unless they want to!)
2. Developers can build applications that utilize resources from many chains/rollups simultaneously

## What can you build with Connext?

Some example use cases:

- Execute the outcome of **DAO votes** across chains
- Lock-and-mint or burn-and-mint **token bridging**
- **Aggregate DEX liquidity** across chains in a single seamless transaction
- Crosschain **vault zaps** and **vault strategy management**
- **Lend funds** on one chain and borrow on another
- Bringing **UniV3 TWAPs** to every chain without introducing oracles
- **NFT bridging** and chain-agnostic NFT marketplaces
- **Store data on Arweave/Filecoin** directly from within an Ethereum smart contract

## How do I interact with Connext?

Developers can send an `xcall` and the protocol will then split actions between a Liquidity Layer (Connext) and a Messaging Layer.

You can see this in action in the [Developer Quickstart](../developers/examples/quickstart).
