# Introduction

## What are Routers?

Routers are one of the two liquidity providers used in the Connext Network. The routerâ€™s role is essential; to provide instant liquidity for the user in the destination chain. Routers are given a fee based on the transaction size in return. Routers then claim the spent fund plus the fee from the AMB bridge after the latency period ends.
